    <title>JAudioTagger Overview</title>

<body>
<p>The aim of JAudioTagger is to provide a world class Java library for editing
    tag information in audio files. Most existing solutions are not java based
    inhibiting the use of java applications with digital files.

<p>JaudioTagger was branched from the jid3lib project which provided the basis
    for an ID3 tagging api, but was incomplete. I wanted to move away from the ID3
    centric nature of the project and provide support for other tagging formats.
    Since Spring 2005 have been concentrating on fixes to the source and making the
    design more robust so currently it only supports ID3, but hope this will change
    soon, I have started work on a virtual intermediate format to allow the mapping
    of any audio format to any other audio format. You can find out more about the
    original project goals in the Development Goals page.
