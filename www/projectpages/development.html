<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Welcome to JAudiotagger. The aim of this project is to provide a world class Java library for editing tag information in audio files. Most existing solutions are not java based inhibiting the use of java applications with digital files.
<p>This project was branched from the <a href="http://jid3lib.dev.java.net">jid3lib</a> project which provided the basis for an ID3 tagging api, but was incomplete. I wanted to move
away from the ID3 centric nature of the project and provide support for other tagging formats. Since Spring 2005 have been concentrating on fixes to the source and making the design more robust so currently it only supports ID3, but hope this will change soon, I have started work on a virtual intermediate format to allow the mapping of any audio format to any other audio format.
