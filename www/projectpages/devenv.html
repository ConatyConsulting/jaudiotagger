<h3>Development</h3>
<p>In general Java developers welcome,these are currently the areas where we could to with some help,easiest tasks first:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improving the Javadocs, their quality is not very good at the moment</li>
<li>Writing Junit tests, I know this is dull but they really do help and will become more important as this project grows</li>
<li>Fixing bugs for the lesser used frames, the text frames are stable but there are some frames such as ASPI which are definenly broken</li>
<li>Fixing bugs for Lyrics3, the Lyrics3 part of the API is broken</li>
<li>Skeletal implementations for different Audio formats, it should be possible to create subclasses of AbstractAudioHeader for the different file types independently</li>
</ul>
