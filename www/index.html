<p>Welcome to JAudiotagger. The aim of this project is to provide a world class Java library for editing tag information in audio files. Most existing solutions are not java based inhibiting the use of java applications with digital files.
<p>This project was branched from the <a href="http://jid3lib.dev.java.net">jid3lib</a> project which provided the basis for an ID3 tagging api, but was incomplete. I wanted to move
away from the ID3 centric nature of the project and provide support for other tagging formats. Since Spring 2005 have been concentrating on fixes to the source and making the design more robust so currently it only supports ID3, but hope this will change soon, I have started work on a virtual intermediate format to allow the mapping of any audio format to any other audio format.
You can find out more about the original project goals in the <a href="http://jaudiotagger.dev.java.net/projectpages/development.html">Development Goals</a> page.
</p>
<h3>Releases</h3>
<p>All releases can be downloaded using cvs from the releases folder, we provide a binary and a source jar for every release. Currently the release schedule is informal, new releases are added every so often when there have been enough changes to warrant a new release. The api is relatively stable but improvements will lead to some changes in the public api, but these will be minor.
</p>
<p>
The full set of releases can be viewed in the <a href="http://jaudiotagger.dev.java.net/projectpages/releases.html">Releases</a> page.

<p>
The latest release can be downloaded from here, for the complete distribution you will require cvs
<ul>
<li>Source <a href="http://jaudiotagger.dev.java.net/source/browse/*checkout*/jaudiotagger/releases/jaudiotaggersrc1_0_0.jar">jaudiotaggersrc1_0_0.jar</a>
<li>Binary <a href="http://jaudiotagger.dev.java.net/source/browse/*checkout*/jaudiotagger/releases/jaudiotagger1_0_0.jar">jaudiotagger1_0_0.jar</a>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Java 1.4.2 is required, although I am thinking about upgrading the requirement to Java 1.5</p>
<h3>Getting involved</h3>
<p>
Any discussion, including questions, comments, criticisms, or compliments can be directed to the relevant <a href="https://jaudiotagger.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectForumView">Discussion Forum</a>. You can also access the Mailing Lists if you wish, although their use for general discussion is discouraged because they are less visible to casual users. If you have a specific bug, feature, or issue to discuss, then it should be posted to the Issue Tracker.

JAudiotagger is currently being developed by Paul Taylor. If you wish to contact me directly, feel free to E-mail me at <a href="mailto:paultaylor@dev.java.net">paultaylor@dev.java.net</a>
</p>
<h3>Documentation</h3>
<p>Javadoc for the latest code can be found <a href="http://jaudiotagger.dev.java.net/nonav/javadoc/index.html">here</a></p>
<p>UML diagrams for latest code has yet to be started</p>

<h3>Applications that use jaudiotagger</h3>
<p></p>
<h3>Development</h3>
<p>In general Java developers welcome,these are currently the areas where we could to with some help,easiest tasks first:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improving the Javadocs, their quality is not very good at the moment</li>
<li>Writing Junit tests, I know this is dull but they really do help and will become more important as this project grows</li>
<li>Fixing bugs for the lesser used frames, the text frames are stable but there are some frames such as ASPI which are definenly broken</li>
<li>Fixing bugs for Lyrics3, the Lyrics3 part of the API is broken</li>
<li>Skeletal implementations for different Audio formats, it should be possible to create subclasses of AbstractAudioHeader for the different file types independently</li>
</ul>
<h4>Requesting Roles</h3>
<p>Please send me an email at <a href="mailto:paultaylor@dev.java.net">paultaylor@dev.java.net</a> to request a role within the project stating what you would like to do any experience of
working on Java/Open source projects </p>
<h4>Development Environment</h3>
<p>You will need to install csv for source control and ant for builds,junit is used for unit testing. The favoured IDE is IntelliJ JetBrains and there is an IntelliJ project setup but you can you whatever IDE you feel comfortable with</p>
