<p>Welcome to JAudiotagger. The aim of this project is to provide a world class Java library for editing tag information in audio files. Most existing solutions are not java based inhibiting the use of java applications with digital files.
<p>This project was branched from the <a href="http://jid3lib.dev.java.net">jid3lib</a> project which provided the basis for an ID3 tagging api, but was incomplete. I wanted to move
away from the ID3 centric nature of the project and provide support for other tagging formats. Since Spring 2005 have been concentrating on fixes to the source and making the design more robust so currently it only supports ID3, but hope this will change soon, I have started work on a virtual intermediate format to allow the mapping of any audio format to any other audio format.
You can find out more about the original project goals in the <a href="http://jaudiotagger.dev.java.net/projectpages/development.html">Development Goals</a> page.

<h3>Releases</h3>
<p>All releases can be downloaded using cvs from the releases folder, we provide a binary and a source jar for every release. Currently the release schedule is informal, new releases are added every so often when there have been enough changes to warrant a new release. The api is relatively stable but improvements will lead to some changes in the public api, but these will be minor.
