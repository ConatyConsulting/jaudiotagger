 <h2>Description</h2>
 <div><h4>Mission</h4>
<p>The aim of this project is to provide a world class Java library for editing tag information in audio files. Most existing solutions are not - java based inhibiting the use of java applications in the Online Music arena.
</p>
<h4>Background:</h4>
<p>This project has been built on top of the MUSICTAG project in Sourceforge by Eric Farng but this only supports ID3 and MP3s, and development seems to have ground to a halt.
</p>
<h4>Plans:</h4>
<p>
I would like to extend the project to support other audio formats such as as Oggvorbis, MP4 and AAC with ID3 and add support for other meta-information tags such as Ogg Comment and APEv2.

I would also like to extend support for ID3 so that is complete. Examples of areas currently not supported are 
Synchronised Headers and Compressed Frames.

I will provide a virtual intermediate format to allow the mapping of any audio format to any other audio format.

I would like to provide an XML format to allow meta-information to be exchanged in a user readable format.
